# Fraud-Prediction
In this project, a predicitive model for fraud detection is built..

- The data set consists of car insurance claims of a Belgian insurer for retail policy-holders (i.e. not companies but individuals)
- The goal is to develop a predictive model which can identify fraudulent claims, based on claims which were previously identified as being fraudulent or suspicious. Multiple reasons can make a claim suspicious or fraudulent, e.g. exaggeration of damages, staging an accident, trying to submit the same claim twice or at different insurance companies, etc.
- The data was obtained in the years 2017 (train set) 2018 (test set)
- The test set does not contain the target, so you will need to split up the train set accordingly into your own validation and test set. The test set supplied here is to rank and assess your model on the competition leaderboard
- The features were obtained at the start of the handling process of each claim (registration/intake/entry). The reason for this being that we want the model to be utilized on new cases as they come in, rather than at the very end
